# Sudoku-Validator
This is a C++ code project that checks if a given Sudoku puzzle is valid, solved or invalid using smart pointers. The program checks if each row, column, and sector of the puzzle contains the digits 1 through 9 with no duplicates. The input is a string of 81 characters, with each digit of the puzzle represented by its corresponding character and empty spaces represented by a blank space. This program then output if a sudoku is valid, solved or invalid (along with reasons).
